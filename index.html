        As SVP of Product and Services at ForeSee, John drove the development and commercial introduction of ForeSee’s next-generation product platform, providing greater strategic decision-making support and organizational leverage to ForeSee clients. He headed up the research team which drove ForeSee’s ongoing innovation in predictive analytics as well as overseeing ForeSee’s large client services organization, which helps clients efficiently deliver excellent customer experiences and thereby achieve superior business outcomes.
		<br /><br />
		John’s extensive executive experience includes his tenure as Vice President of Research and Development at Micro Focus, where John headed a global software development organization that rationalized multiple acquired products and technologies into a coherent, high growth platform. As Senior Vice President of  Product &amp; Commercial Enablement at Compuware Corporation, John drove product and M&amp;A initiatives that turned a floundering Application Performance Management business into a 30%+ growth engine that became Compuware’s flagship offering. He went on to restructure the company into focused business units – making it possible to optimize each business and divest underperforming product lines. At AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories, John developed a roadmap for delivery of a next-generation solution combining processor and peripherals on a single silicon chip.
		<br /><br />
		Over the course of his career, John has identified, evaluated, negotiated, performed due diligence, defined and executed commercial and product integration strategies for dozens of tactical and strategic acquisitions - as well as divesting and restructuring underperforming business units. He has aligned go-to-market and product initiatives to target focused market opportunities.

        As a founding member of the ForeSee executive team in 2001, Cia grew the company to over 300 employees and developed hiring and training practices that created a cohesive, passionate team of the most talented professionals in the world, which was instrumental to the company’s financial success and lucrative exit.
