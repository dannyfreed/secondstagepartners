        As SVP of Product and Services at ForeSee, John drove the development and commercial introduction of ForeSee’s next-generation product platform, providing greater strategic decision-making support and organizational leverage to ForeSee clients. He headed up the research team which drove ForeSee’s ongoing innovation in predictive analytics as well as overseeing ForeSee’s large client services organization, which helps clients efficiently deliver excellent customer experiences and thereby achieve superior business outcomes.
		<br /><br />
		John’s extensive executive experience includes his tenure as Vice President of Research and Development at Micro Focus, where John headed a global software development organization that rationalized multiple acquired products and technologies into a coherent, high growth platform. As Senior Vice President of  Product &amp; Commercial Enablement at Compuware Corporation, John drove product and M&amp;A initiatives that turned a floundering Application Performance Management business into a 30%+ growth engine that became Compuware’s flagship offering. He went on to restructure the company into focused business units – making it possible to optimize each business and divest underperforming product lines. At AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories, John developed a roadmap for delivery of a next-generation solution combining processor and peripherals on a single silicon chip.
		<br /><br />
		Over the course of his career, John has identified, evaluated, negotiated, performed due diligence, defined and executed commercial and product integration strategies for dozens of tactical and strategic acquisitions - as well as divesting and restructuring underperforming business units. He has aligned go-to-market and product initiatives to target focused market opportunities.  He has redefined product positioning and messaging to resonate with the business priorities of senior decision makers - resulting in greater sales productivity and scalability.

        As a founding member of the ForeSee executive team in 2001, Cia grew the company to over 300 employees and developed hiring and training practices that created a cohesive, passionate team of the most talented professionals in the world, which was instrumental to the company’s financial success and lucrative exit. More specifically, Cia built a determined and scalable sales force, implementing structural organization models, motivational compensation plans, and a rigorous training program, all resulting in a high powered, motivated, and successful sales team. Across other departments at ForeSee, Cia partnered with each division head to create scalable organization structures with the greatest opportunity for investment and growth. By creating positive communication methods she was able to create a collaborative team environment where employees feel comfortable contributing at their highest potential, because her philosophy is that employees are a company’s strongest asset.

		Previous to joining ForeSee, Cia was with Compuware where she was Director of Human Resources and Recruiting. She was able to lead the specialty practice by building a team of talented individuals as well as integrating acquired resources for mutual maximum benefit. The practice grew to 400 employees within two years.
		<br /><br />
		Her other experience includes playing critical roles in other organizations such as American SCI (Ajilon) and CBSI (Covansys) where she led the recruiting practice and was able to use creative resourcing to hire the best and the brightest in a rapid business growth model. Her efforts impacted company value and contributed to successful acquisitions.

They waste a lot of time hiring people that don’t work out, reinventing the wheel when it comes to building out various departments. 2nd Stage Partners can come in and tell you where you need to focus, what areas can afford to be ignored for awhile longer, and then they can actually do the work that needs to be done so that capital can be used efficiently and effectively for accelerated growth.

	  	<p>There are unprecedented efforts underway in both the private and public sector to get companies started, and that’s a great thing. But then what?

		<p>Early-stage and mid-stage  companies have a huge synchronization problem. They may have a great product but no effective sales structure to sell it, or they may have a fantastic sales team but very little marketing, which makes selling inefficient. All too often it takes too long to bring those deficient areas up to speed and for the company to reach it’s potential.  2nd Stage Partners’ proposition--for which I believe there is real need--is to step in and fill the most mission-critical gaps to synchronize company efforts and drive maximum capital efficiency.
